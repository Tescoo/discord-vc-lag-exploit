discord vc exploit to lightly lag vcs

# how to use

open the py file,
then open devtools on discord, go to network and join a vc, dont start watching a screenshare but you should see a request called ?v=5

(reason you should watch a screenshare is it makes 2 and it can confuse)
click on it and copy the websocket (request) url

then paste it into the console, DONT CLOSE DEVTOOLS, then enter then paste in the server id
then YOUR user id
then get a randdom id of someone in the vc and pop it in
if you listened and didnt close devtools, go to messages at the top

then scroll up and select one with opcode 0
expand it like this and copy the session id and token

pop both in and click enter, if you are disconnecting and reconnecting that means its working, the vc should be (not much) lagging and people should be reconnecting/rtc connecting.

also works in stage discovery and that shit and works better in big vcs

i used this to fuck rythm vc on the like last listen event or something
